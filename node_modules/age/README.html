<p><strong>AGE</strong> implements an abstract gamification engine.</p>
<p>Clients define <strong><em>achievement rules</em></strong> which define conditions that <strong><em>players</em></strong> must meet in order to earn the corresponding <strong>achievement</strong> and publish <strong>events</strong> that represent actions or events that add to a player&#39;s <strong><em>event history</em></strong>.</p>
<p>AGE is implemented in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> but compiled to JavaScript prior to publishing.  It should work in any <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> environment.</p>
<p>(It may also work, or could be made to work, within a browser, but we haven&#39;t had the need for that nor the time to test it.  If you are interested in this feature, please <a href="https://github.com/rodw/age/issues">let us know</a>.)</p>

<p>For a detailed example of how to use the AGE framework, visit <a href="docs/stack-exchange-example.litcoffee">docs/stack-exchange-example.litcoffee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>
<p>AGE is published an an <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> module under the name <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/age">age</a>.</p>
<p>To install it you can run:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g age
</code></pre><p>(Omit the <code>-g</code> to install the package to the <code>node_modules</code> subdirectory of the current working directory rather than to the &quot;global&quot; npm package repository.)</p>
<p>Currently AGE has no external (runtime) dependencies.</p>
